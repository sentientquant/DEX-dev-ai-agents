## Why Archived?
These folders contained thousands of files from the original GitHub repository. They were archived to:
1. Clean up the working data directory
2. Keep only actively used files created on this machine
3. Preserve the original data for reference if needed
4. Free up mental space by removing clutter

## Active Folders Kept:
These are the folders we created on this machine:
- `src/data/rbi_pp_multi/` - Our RBI results
- `src/data/ohlcv/` - Our OHLCV candle data
- `src/data/sentiment/` - Our sentiment analysis
- `src/data/twitter_agent/` - Our Twitter agent data

## Note:
These archived folders can be safely deleted if disk space is needed, or they can remain for reference purposes. All important functionality uses the active folders created on this machine.
