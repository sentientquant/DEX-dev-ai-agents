STRATEGY_NAME: SpeculativeBear

INDICATORS_REQUIRED:
- None

ENTRY_CONDITIONS:
No specific entry conditions mentioned; the strategy generally involves initiating a short sale position on a stock when anticipating a price decline.

EXIT_CONDITIONS:
No specific exit conditions mentioned; typically, short positions would be covered (bought back) upon reaching a profit target, stop-loss, or other discretionary criteria not defined here.

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This strategy focuses on short selling stocks, which means borrowing shares and selling them with the expectation of buying them back at a lower price to return to the lender, profiting from the price difference. Without specified entry or exit rules, it remains highly discretionary and risky, relying on the trader's judgment for timing bearish moves. No technical indicators, filters, or thresholds are provided, making it unsuitable for automated backtesting without additional assumptions. Key risks include unlimited potential losses if the stock price rises, margin requirements, and borrowing costs. In practice, this could be applied to overvalued stocks, negative news events, or broad market downturns, but lacks the precision of indicator-driven approaches. To implement, one might default to fundamental analysis (e.g., high P/E ratios) or basic price action, but as described, it's essentially a directional bet on downside without structured rules.
