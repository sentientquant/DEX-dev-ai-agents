STRATEGY_NAME: BullishCall

INDICATORS_REQUIRED:
- None mentioned

ENTRY_CONDITIONS:
No specific entry conditions mentioned; strategy simply involves buying a call option to profit from potential upward price movement in the underlying asset.

EXIT_CONDITIONS:
No specific exit conditions mentioned; typically, the call option would be sold or held to expiration based on market movement, but no rules provided.

STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This is a fundamental options trading strategy known as a "long call," which is a bullish position where the trader purchases a call option contract giving the right (but not obligation) to buy the underlying asset at a predetermined strike price before expiration. It requires paying a premium upfront, with unlimited profit potential if the underlying asset rises significantly above the strike price, but the maximum loss is limited to the premium paid if the option expires worthless. No technical indicators, filters, or quantitative rules are specified, making it a discretionary or directional bet on upward price movement rather than a systematic strategy. Risk management (e.g., position sizing to limit premium loss) is implied but not detailed. Suitable for volatile markets or when expecting a strong bullish catalyst, but lacks precision for automated backtesting without additional rules.
