STRATEGY_DETAILS:
This is a straightforward directional options strategy focused on bearish market expectations. A long put position involves buying a put option contract, which grants the holder the right (but not the obligation) to sell the underlying asset (e.g., stock, index) at a predetermined strike price before or at expiration. The strategy profits from a decline in the underlying asset's price, as the put's value increases when the asset falls below the strike price (minus the premium paid). Key risks include time decay (theta), where the option's value erodes if the underlying doesn't move sufficiently downward, and the potential for total loss of the premium if the option expires worthless. No technical indicators, filters, or precise timing rules are specified, making this a discretionary approach reliant on fundamental or market sentiment analysis for timing the purchase. Position sizing should account for the leveraged nature of options, and it's often used for speculation or hedging existing long positions. Without defined conditions, backtesting would require user-defined triggers (e.g., based on price levels or volatility).
